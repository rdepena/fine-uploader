## Callbacks ##

For jQuery plug-in users, adhere to the following syntax:
```javascript
$('#myUploader')
    .on('complete', function(event, id, name, response) {
        ...
    })
    .on('cancel', function(event, id, name) {
        ...
    });
```

Note that, if using the jQuery plug-in, you can also bind your callback/event handlers as part of your initialization code, since
the `fineUploader` plug-in returns your target element (`$('#myUploader')`, in this example).

Callbacks must be declared inside of a `callbacks` object for non-jQuery users, like this:
```javascript
new qq.FineUploader({
    ...
    callbacks: {
        onComplete: function(id, name, response) {
            ...
        },
        onCancel: function(id, name) {
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
}
```

### List of callbacks ###

* `onSubmit(String id, String name)` - called when the file or `Blob` is a candidate for uploading.
Note that this does not mean the file upload will begin at this point.  Return `false` to prevent submission to the uploader.
* `onSubmitted(String id, String name)` - called when the file or `Blob` has been successfully submitted to the uploader.  The
file will be uploaded immediately if there is at least one free connection available (see `maxConnections` option) and the `autoUpload`
option is set to true (the default).  This callback is invoked after the `onSubmit` callback has returned without a "false" return value.
In FineUploader mode, it is safe to assume that the associated element(s) in the UI representing the associated file have already been added
to the DOM immediately before this callback is invoked.
* `onComplete(String id, String name, Object responseJSON)` - called when the file or `Blob` upload has finished.
A successful upload will always have a `success` property in the `responseJSON` object with a value of `true`.  The
`responseJSON` parameter will also contain any other elements of the JSON response returned by the server.
* `onCancel(String id, String name)` - called when the file or `Blob` upload has been cancelled.
* `onUpload(String id, String name)` - called just before a file or `Blob` upload begins.
* `onUploadChunk(String id, String name, Object chunkData)` - called just before a `File`/`Blob` chunk/partition request is sent.  The chunkData object has
4 properties: `partIndex` (the 0-based index of the associated partition), `startByte` (the byte offset of the current chunk in terms
of the underlying `File`/`Blob`), `endByte` (the last byte of the current chunk in terms of the underlying `File`/`Blob`), and `totalParts` (the
total number of partitions associated with the underlying `File`/`Blob`).
* `onProgress(String id, String name, int uploadedBytes, int totalBytes)` - called during the upload, as it progresses.  Only used by the XHR/ajax uploader.
* `onError(String id, String name, String errorReason, XMLHttpRequest xhr)` - called whenever an exceptional condition occurs (during an upload, file selection, etc).
Note that the last parameter, xhr, will only be included if the error is related to a request initiated by XMLHttpRequest.
* `onAutoRetry(String id, String name, String attemptNumber)` - called before each automatic retry attempt for a failed file or `Blob`.
* `onManualRetry(String id, String name)` - called before each manual retry attempt.  Return false to prevent this and all future retry attempts on this file or `Blob`.
* `onResume(String id, String fileName, Object chunkData)` - Called before an attempt is made to resume a failed/stopped upload from a previous session.
If you return false, the resume will be cancelled and the uploader will start uploading the file from the first chunk.  The `chunkData` object contains the properties as
the `chunkData` parameter passed into the `onUploadChunk` callback.
* `onValidate(FileOrBlobData fileOrBlobData)` - This callback represents one of the files or `Blob`s selected for upload.  It is called once
for each selected, dropped, or `addFiles` submitted file and for each `addBlobs` submitted `Blob`, provided you do not return false in your `onValidateBatch` handler, and also provided
the `stopOnFirstInvalidFile` validation option is not set and a previous invocation of your `onValidate` callback in this batch has not returned false.
This callback is always invoked before the default Fine Uploader validators execute.  Note that a `FileOrBlobData` object has two properties: `name`
and `size`.  The `size` property will be undefined if the user agent does not support the File API.
* `onValidateBatch(Array fileOrBlobDataArray)` - This callback is invoked once for each batch of files or `Blob`s selected, dropped, or submitted
via the `addFiles` or `addBlobs`  API functions.  A FileOrBlobData array is passed in representing all files or `Blob`s selected or dropped at once.  This allows
you to prevent the entire batch from being uploaded, if desired, by returning false.  If your handler does not return false,
the `onValidate` callback will be invoked once for each individual file or `Blob` submitted.  This callback is always invoked before
the default Fine Uploader validators execute.  Note that a `FileOrBlobData` object has two properties: `name` and `size`.
The `size` property will be undefined if the user agent does not support the File API.
* `onSubmitDelete(id)` - Called before a file or `Blob` that has been marked for deletion has been submitted to the uploader.
You may return false from your handler if you want to ignore/stop the delete request.
* `onDelete(id)` - Called just before a delete request is sent for the associated file or `Blob`.  The parameter is the ID.
* `onDeleteComplete(id, xhr, isError)` - Called after receiving a response from the server for a DELETE request.  The associated
ID, along with the request's XMLHttpRequest object and a boolean indicating whether the response succeeded or not (based on the response code)
are sent along as parameters.
* `onPasteReceived(blob)` - Called when a pasted image has been received (before uploading the image).  The pasted image is
represented as a `Blob`.  **This is a promissory callback**, meaning your callback handler must return a [promise](promise.md).
The value of the success parameter must be the name to associate with the pasted image.  If the associated attempt is marked
a `failure` it is wise to include a string explaining the failure in your `failure` callback.
Note that the `promptForName` in FineUploader mode, if set to true, will effectively wipe out any custom implementation of this
callback.  The two are not meant to be used together.  This callback is meant to provide an alternative means to provide a name
for a pasted image (such as via an ajax call).  If FineUploaderBasic mode is in use and you want to display your own user prompt
for the name, you may also do so by overriding the default implementation of this callback.
